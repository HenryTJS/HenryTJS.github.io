                <p>Leadership is the quality of being good at leading a group, organization, country, etc. (<i>Longman Dictionary Online</i>, 2006). Perhaps some people think that leadership skills are innate, which can hinder the development of their leadership path (Winch G., 2015). But leadership is not mysterious, which can be learned through hard work. Here are some ways to improve your leadership.</p>
                <p>First, before you start leading something, ask yourself if you're willing to do it. Research in Illinois (as cited in Winch G., 2015) states that willingness, or positive leadership, is the most important factor in student success. At the same time, you need to be clear about the purpose of leadership. Linsky M. (personal communication, Feb. 29<sup>th</sup>, 2008) points out that knowing what you want to do is a critical step in improving your leadership skills, and knowing what risks you will take is needed.</p>
                <p>Second, recognizing yourself. It has been shown (Winch G., 2015) that leadership skills can be improved through self-reflection and hard work. Linsky M. (personal communication, Feb. 29<sup>th</sup>, 2008) believes that Some people are overconfident and believe that leadership is innate, which is not conducive to the effective manifestation of their leadership abilities. So, confident, sociable people may need some self-reflection (Tannenbaum N., 2013). On the other hand, if you don't know where to start, recognizing your strengths and weaknesses allows you to identify the skills you need (Linsky M., personal communication, Feb. 29<sup>th</sup>, 2008). Also, Winch G. (2015) emphasizes that developing leadership requires confronting success and failure.</p>
                <p>Third, mastering the skills. One multi-year study (as cited in Tannenbaum N., 2013) shows that the way to create optimal performance is to build a skills-based leadership model. Tannenbaum N. (2013) also mentions that Managers can benefit from management training that focuses on improving skills. Coincidentally, Linsky M. (personal communication, Feb. 29<sup>th</sup>, 2008) stresses that every basic leadership skill can be taught and learned. Leadership is experimental, and you have to have practical skills, otherwise you can't be an effective leader (Linsky M., personal communication, Feb. 29<sup>th</sup>, 2008).</p>
                <p>Fourth, building good relationships. According to Winch G. (2015), in order for teams to move toward a common goal, leaders need to focus on interactions, relationships and communication. In order to accomplish their goals, people often need encouragement. Encouraging employees to feel like they're part of a team allows them to perform better (Kouzes & Posner, 1995, 2002, as cited in Abdullah & Samer & Aieman, 2008). In addition, it is important to "let go". Empowering others to act and giving others the freedom to make choices in decision-making is conducive to realizing their potential. In Kouzes and Posner’s opinion (as cited in Abdullah & Samer & Aieman, 2008), empowering others to act and giving others the freedom to make choices in decision-making is conducive to realizing their potential. Let others be in control and allow yourself to do high-level work (Linsky M., personal communication, Feb. 29<sup>th</sup>, 2008).</p>
                <p>Fifth, there are a number of other competencies that leaders need to possess, such as adaptability, tolerance and ability to challenge. People who excel in leadership are able to balance ideals and realities, and are able to find and adapt to changing circumstances (Linsky M., personal communication, Feb. 29<sup>th</sup>, 2008). Tolerance of uncertainty and conflict is an essential part of resolving difficult problems, too (Linsky M., personal communication, Feb. 29<sup>th</sup>, 2008). Also, making a difference in the organization through creative ideas and learning from mistakes can make a difference (Kouzes & Posner, 1995, 2002, as cited in Abdullah & Samer & Aieman, 2008).</p>
                <p>To sum up, you don't need talent to have leadership skills, and they can be taught and learned, provided you put in the effort</p>
